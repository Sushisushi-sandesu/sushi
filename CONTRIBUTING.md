Thank you for your contribution.

## Coding Style

Our coding style follows [Coding Guidelines of Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/community/contributing/coding-guidelines/) in this project.

## Development Flow

TL;DR

1. Casually post issues to manage and share problems/tasks/ideas.
2. Checkout a new branch and work on your task after creating a pull request w/ the **[WIP]** title prefix.
3. Get reviews from at least 2 reviewers and repeatedly update your implementation based on their comments.

Finally, if you get 2 LGTMs (accepted by the reviewers), you can merge the branch and remove it.

### 1. Making Issues

When you find a new issue or have some ideas, you should do:

1. making a new issue
2. someone (of course you) adopting the issue marked the assignee's box

### 2. Solving Issues with Pull Request

When you are assigned an issue, you need to first make a new branch (should be from the master) and create a new pull request. Early pull requesting allows other members to track your progress. 

Note that you must add the **[WIP]** prefix for the title of pull request until the issue is solved.

## 3. Closing Issues

When the **[WIP]** prefix is removed and the ***ready for review*** tag is set, the pull request is ready to merge.

At least "2" reviewers must accept and comment to the pull request before any merging. You should repeatedly update your implementation based on their review comments.
